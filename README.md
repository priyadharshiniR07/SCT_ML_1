🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Task 1 - SkillCraft Technology Internship
This project aims to predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using Linear Regression. It was completed as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology.

📊 Overview
In this project, I built a supervised machine learning model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices. The dataset includes the following features:

📐 Square Footage

🛏️ Number of Bedrooms

🛁 Number of Bathrooms

💰 Price (Target Variable)

🧠 Objective
To train a regression model that:

Predicts the house price given the input features.

Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
